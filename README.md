# Computational-Physics
Simulations + numerical methods in C++ to solve selected problems in physics! 

In this repository are C++ files for simulations/numerical methods completed in my Computational Physics class! In this course I had the opportunity to program super cool simulations like Monte Carlo simulations and molecular dynamics. I wanted to have a repository to share everything I learned here!
